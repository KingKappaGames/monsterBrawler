/// @param {bool} [spanTime]=false If this is a non zero value it will calculate the length of the animation to fit this many frames, so if you know an action should take 90 frames and you want a 7 frame animation to play over that "span" then this will set the speed to.. ~13 assuming 1 ide speed (also handled)
/// @param {bool} [spanFromBeginning]=false With regards to the span calculations, this will either span the remaining frames to the end, or one full loop of frames. False being from current (the set image index) or true for loop once from wherever you start at
